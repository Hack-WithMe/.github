# Hack With Me

Welcome to **Hack With Me**! 👋  
Hack With Me is a yearly, 24-hour hackathon for high school students that always takes place on **August 16th**. It’s a space where students come together to create exciting projects, solve real-world problems, and build their coding skills in a fun and collaborative environment. 

We believe Hack With Me should be accessible to everyone. That’s why anyone can host their own Hack With Me hackathon in their community. Together, we can make this a global movement!
